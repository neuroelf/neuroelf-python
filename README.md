# NeuroElf (python)
This repository is, for now, simply meant to contain certain functions that
have been translated from their MATLAB equivalent, and isn't particularly
useful, other than for educational purposes.

Please refer to the [neuroelf-matlab](https://github.com/neuroelf/neuroelf-matlab)
repository for an overview of what NeuroElf is about.
